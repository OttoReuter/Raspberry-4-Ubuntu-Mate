# RPi4-Ubuntu-Server
10. September 2019:

The new Raspberry 4 is currently only supported by Raspbian Buster. This is very disappointing because everyone had expected more. Therefore, here you can build an Ubuntu Mate Image (experimental status) for the Raspberry 4 with 64 bit and 4 GB support.
It is based on the Image Ubuntu Server 18.04.3 from James A. Chambers (https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-ubuntu-server-18-04-2-installation-guide/).
My settings are in German.

Here you can download the image - ubuntu-server with gnome-desktop for Raspberry Pi 4B.
